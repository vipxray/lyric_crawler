['Weird Al Yankovic Lyrics', 'Albuquerque Lyrics', 'Way back when I was just a little bitty boy living in a box under the \r\nstairs in the corner of the basement of the house half a block down the \r\nstreet from Jerry\'s Bait Shop... You know the place... Well anyway, \r\nback then life was going swell and everything was juuuuust peachy... \r\nexcept of course for the undeniable fact that every single morning my \r\nmother would make me a big ol\' bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast. \r\nDawww!! Big bowl of sauerkraut! \r\nEvery single mornin\'! It was driving me crazy. \n\r\nI said to my mom, I said, "Hey, mom, what\'s up with all the sauerkraut?" \r\nAnd my dear, sweet mother, she just looked at me like a cow looks at an \r\noncoming train. And she leaned right down next to me, and she said, "IT\'S \r\nGOOD FOR YOU!" And then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my \r\nmouth and force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until I was 26 and a half \r\nyears old. \n\r\nThat\'s when I swore that someday, someday I would get outta that \r\nbasement and travel to a magical, far away place, where the sun is \r\nalways shining and the air smells like warm root beer, and the towels \r\nare oh so fluffy! Where the shriners and the lepers play their ukuleles \r\nall day long, and anyone on the street will gladly shave your back for \r\na nickel! \n\r\nWacka wacka, doo doo, yeah! \n\r\nWell, let me tell you, people, it wasn\'t long at all before my dream \r\ncame true. Because the very next day, a local radio station had this \r\ncontest to see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in \r\nLeonard Nimoy\'s butt. I was off by three, but I still won the grand \r\nprize. That\'s right, a first class, one-way ticket... \n\r\nto Albuquerque! \r\nAlbuquerque! \n\r\nOh yeah. You know, I\'d never been on a real airplane before, and I gotta \r\ntell ya, it was really great... except that I had to sit between two large \r\nAlbanian women with excruciatingly severe body odor. And the little kid in \r\nback of me kept throwin\' up the whole time. The flight attendants ran out of \r\nDr. Pepper and salted peanuts, and the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with \r\nPauly Shore...and, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned out, and we \r\nwent into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside and the plane exploded in a \r\ngiant fireball and everybody died. Except for me. You know why? \n\r\n\'Cause I had my tray table up \r\nAnd my seat back in the full upright position \r\nHad my tray table up \r\nAnd my seat back in the full upright position \r\nHad my tray table up \r\nAnd my seat back in the full upright position \n\r\nAh-ha-ha-ha. Ah-ha-ha. Aahhh. So I crawled from the twisted, burnin\' \r\nwreckage, I crawled on my hands and knees for three full days, draggin\' \r\nalong my big leather suitcase and my garment bag and my tenor saxophone \r\nand my 12-pound bowlin\' ball and my lucky, lucky autographed \r\nglow-in-the-dark snorkel. But finally I arrived at the world famous \r\nAlbuquerque Holiday Inn where the towels are oh so fluffy! And you can \r\neat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna. It\'s OK, they\'re \r\nclean. \n\r\nWell, I checked into my room, and I turned down the A/C, and I turned \r\non the SpectraVision, and I\'m just about to eat that little chocolate \r\nmint on my pillow that I love so very, very much, when suddenly there\'s \r\na knock on the door. Well, now, who could that be? \n\r\nI say, "Who is it?" No answer. \r\n"Who is it?" There\'s no answer. \r\n"WHO IS IT!?" They\'re not sayin\' anything. \r\nSo finally, I go over and I open the door, and just as I suspected, \r\nit\'s some big, fat hermaphrodite with a flock of seagulls, haircut, and \r\nonly one nostril. Oh, man, I hate it when I\'m right. \n\r\nSo, anyway, he bursts into my room, and he grabs my lucky snorkel, and \r\nI\'m like, "Hey, you can\'t have that! That snorkel\'s been just like a \r\nsnorkel to me." \n\r\nAnd he\'s like, "Tough!" \r\nAnd I\'m like, "Give it!" \r\nAnd he\'s like, "Make me!" \r\nAnd I\'m like, "\'kay!" \r\nSo I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus, and I bit off his ear \r\nand he chewed off my eyebrows, and I took out his appendix and he gave \r\na colonic irrigation, yes indeed, you better believe it. And somehow in \r\nthe middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hook. And twenty \r\nseconds later, I heard a familiar voice. And you know what it said? \r\nI\'ll tell ya what it said! \n\r\nIt said, "If you\'d like to make a call, please hang up and try again. \r\nIf you need help, hang up and then dial your operator. \r\nIf you\'d like to make a call, please hang up and try again. \r\nIf you need help, hang up and then dial your operator." \n\r\nIn Albuquerque! \r\nAlbuquerque! \n\r\nWell, to cut a long story short, he got away with my snorkel. But I \r\nmade a solemn vow right then and there that I would not rest, I would \r\nnot sleep for an instant, until the one-nostrilled man was brought to \r\njustice. \n\r\nBut first, I decided to buy some donuts. So I got in my car, and I \r\ndrove over to the donut shop, and I walked on up to the guy behind the \r\ncounter and he says, "Yeah, whaddaya want??" \n\r\nI said, "You got any glazed donuts?" \r\nHe said, "Nah, we\'re outta glazed donuts." \r\nI say, "Well, you got any jelly donuts?" \r\nHe said, "No, we\'re outta jelly donuts." \r\nI said, "You got any Bavarian cream-filled donuts?" \r\nHe said, "No, we\'re outta Bavarian cream-filled donuts." \r\nI said, "You got any cinnamon rolls?" \r\nHe said, "No, we\'re outta cinnamon rolls!" \r\nI said, "You got any apple fritters?" \r\nHe said, "No, we\'re outta apple fritters!" \r\nI said, "You got any bear claws?" \r\nHe said, "Wait a minute, I\'ll go check." \n\r\n"No, we\'re outta bear claws!" \r\nI said, "Well, in that case... in that case, what do you have?" \r\nHe says, "All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving crazed weasels." \r\nI said, "OK, I\'ll take that." \r\nSo he hands me the box, and I open up the lid, and the weasels jump out \r\nand they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin\' me all over. \r\nOh, man, they were just goin\' nuts! They were tearin\' me apart! You \r\nknow, I think it was just about that time that a little ditty started \r\ngoin\' through my head. I believe it went a little somethin\' like this: \n\r\nDOH! Get \'em off me! Get \'em off me! Ohhh! No, get \'em off, get \'em \r\noff! Oh, oh God, oh God! Oh, get \'em off me! Oh, oh God! Ah, \r\nAaaaaaahhhhhhhhhOhhhhhhhhhh! \n\r\nI ran out into the street with these flesh-eating weasels all over my \r\nface, wavin\' my arms all around and just runnin\', runnin\', runnin\' like \r\na constipated wiener dog. And as luck would have it, that\'s exactly \r\nwhen I ran into the girl of my dreams. Her name was Zelda. She was a \r\ncaligraphy enthusiast, with a slight overbite, and hair the color of \r\nstrained peaches. I\'ll never forget the very first thing she said to \r\nme. She said, "Hey, you\'ve got weasels on your face." \n\r\nThat\'s when I knew it was true love. We were inseparable after that. \r\nAw, we ate together, we bathed together, we even shared the same piece \r\nof mint-flavored dental floss. The world was our burrito. So we got \r\nmarried, and we bought us a house and had two beautiful children, \r\nNathaniel and Superfly. Oh we were so very, very, very happy, oh yeah. \r\nBut then, one fateful night, Zelda said to me, she said, "Sweetie \r\npumpkin? Do you wanna join the Columbia Record Club?" I said, "Woah! \r\nHold on now, baby! I\'m just not ready for that kind of a commitment!" \n\r\nSo we broke up, and I never saw her again \r\nbut that\'s just the way things go \n\r\nIn Albuquerque! \r\nAlbuquerque! \n\r\nAnyway, things really started lookin\' up for me, because about a week \r\nlater, I finally achieved my lifelong dream. That\'s right, I got me a \r\npart-time job at the Sizzler! I even made employee of the month after I \r\nput out that grease fire with my face. Aw yeah, everybody was pretty \r\njealous of me after that. I was gettin\' a lot of attitude. \n\r\nOK, like one time, I was out in the parkin\' lot, tryin\' to remove my excess \r\nearwax with a golf pencil, when I see this guy Marty \r\ntryin\' to carry a big ol\' sofa up the stairs all by himself. So I-I say to \r\nhim, I say, "Hey, you want me to help you with that?" And \r\nMarty, he just rolls his eyes and goes, "No, I want you \r\nto cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw!" So I did. \n\r\nAnd then he gets all indignant on me. He\'s like, "Hey, man, I was just \r\nbeing sarcastic!" Well, that\'s just great. How was I supposed to know \r\nthat? I\'m not a mind reader, for cryin\' out loud. Besides, now he\'s got \r\na really cute nickname - Torso-Boy! So what\'s he complaining about? \n\r\nSay, that reminds me of another amusing anecdote. This guy comes up to \r\nme on the street and he tells me he hasn\'t had a bite in three days. \r\nWell, I knew what he meant, but just to be funny, I took a big bite out \r\nof his jugular vein. And he\'s yelling and screaming and bleeding all \r\nover, and I\'m like, "Hey, come on, don\'tcha get it?" But he just keeps \r\nrolling around on the sidewalk, bleeding and screaming, "Aaaahhhh! \r\nAaaaahhhhOhhhhh! Aaaaahhhh!" You know, completely missing the irony of \r\nthe whole situation. Man, some people just can\'t take a joke, you know? \n\r\nAnyway, um...um...where was I? Kinda lost my train of thought. \n\r\nUh, well, uh, OK, anyway, I-I know it\'s kind of a roundabout way of \r\nsaying it, but, I guess the whole point I\'m tryin\' to make here is... \r\nI HATE SAUERKRAUT! \n\r\nThat\'s all I\'m really tryin\' to say. And, by the way, \r\nif one day you happen to wake up and find yourself in an existential \r\nquandry, full of loathing and self-doubt and wracked with the pain and \r\nisolation of your pitiful meaningless existence, at least you can take \r\na small bit of comfort in knowing that somewhere out there in this \r\ncrazy ol\' mixed-up universe of ours, there\'s still a little place \n\r\ncalled Albuquerque! \r\nAlbuquerque! \r\nAlbuquerque!

Its surprising isn’t it I could never hold my liquor. Never once in my drinking history did I not  get fully pissed, every time. I have never ever had one drink and I have never ever been sober after two. Cheap date the funniest date, the loudest joke, the potty mouth.  Well I remember this one time standing behind the bar where the bar tender was working and because I knew two photographers from national geographic were sittn at the bar I was showing them my tricks…watch the Canadian gurl pick the pimento out of the olive with her tongue, yeah always a barrel of laughs. How could I be taken seriously I was drunk., I don’t know, I feel kind of weird I feel kind of stupid its weird, in not necessarily bitter, but I cant never drink again, I feel better I feel in control, I don’t know how I drank, I really don’t know how I drank all that time. I don’t think drinking is for everybody, but I don’t think not drinking’s for everybody, but I got to say, sobriety make heign sight beyond 20/20. And I still think and will always maintain, ALCOHOL IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL. ']
['Bif Naked Lyrics', 'Alcohol Or Comedy Lyrics', 'My life was comedy, quitting drinking was the easiest thing I’ve ever done, I have never looked back. I can not simply understand why the hell I waited so long…unmanageable life! What an embarrassment, what a weakness, what a ultimate lack of self-discipline, what a loser.  My parents never drank or smoked; I put them through hell, poor parents. I was such an ungrateful disrespectful, selfish, hormonal little teenager, with a mouthy attitude, and sense of humor quite unlike my sisters.  I decided I dint need to continue attending church with my parents; I was searching for my individuality.  What an idiot, I wanted attention, I wanted everyone to think I was funny, I wanted everyone to like me, I hated myself.  I was called bug eyes, I was called fish lips, and I was called modern dairies.  The grade 9 gurls hated me they harassed me and beat me up. I wonder how those gurls are now.  I wonder if they are living exciting fulfilling loving lives, I wonder if there happy and healthy.  Me and my best friend Karime had every line of every Eddie Murphy movie down….goo la goo goo, you could smell it, im a karate man! Karate man bruise on the inside so they don’t show their weakness…banana in the tail pipe..bah boola bah boola bah boola bu ha ha bah boola bah boola bah boola ha! You name it I wanted to be Eddie Murphy or Robin Williams.  I wanted to be them I still am enraptured with comedians, they must always be carefree and laughing and playing jokes, and having fun, except for maybe Richard Lewis, he always says he cant get a date, bet ya he can, bet ya hes really ticklish.  Like me…tickled with life, tickled pink, pink ladies, black Russians, iron butterflies, Quitting drinking was the easiest thing I ever done, Quitting my comedic dreams was hard…I can never look back on either. \n']
