And did it occur to you that it\'s almost exactly the same today? And so if our schools won\'t teach us, we\'ll have to teach ourselves to analyze and understand the systems of thought-control. And share it with each other, never sayed by brass rings or the threat of penalty. I\'ll promise you- you promise me- not to sell each other out to murderers, to thieves... who\'ve manufactured our delusion that you and me participate meaningfully in the process of running our own lives. Yeah, you can vote however the fuck you want, but power still calls all the shots.
